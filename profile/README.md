## 🤝 Work With Us

We're always looking for opportunities to collaborate and build new projects.

- **Clients:** Point us at the KPI that matters and the date it needs to move. We'll own the path to production.
- **Developers:** Find an issue (or build a feature), open a PR, and then [email](mailto:hello@theneurallab.com) us to skip the technical interview.
- **Partners:** Together, let's raise the bar on what "done" looks like. Connect with us to explore how we can collaborate together.

## 📦 Featured Public Repos

While most of our codebases are private, we have plenty of `public` repos that fall into two buckets:

1. Open-source projects we build with the community.
2. Code drops from our social media posts (small, self-contained demos that accompany our build videos).

### 🎥 From Our Social Media

We frequently post short build demos on our [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@theneurallab) and ship the companion code here.

Have a feature idea you want to see on video? Tell us about it → [hello@theneurallab.com](mailto:hello@theneurallab.com)

### 🎮 Contributing

These projects are intentionallay simple and educational. If you spot a bug or want to extend a demo:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -m 'Add your feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
5. Open a PR with a short description and screenshots/gifs if relevant

We review and merge PRs quickly ⚡️
